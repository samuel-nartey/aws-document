Figure 1: AWS account registration page

Create AWS Account: Go to aws.amazon.com

Set up billing alerts: Configure budget alerts to avoid unexpected charges

Create IAM User: Never use root account for daily operations

🛠️ Local Environment Setup
Step 2: Install Required Software
bash
# Install Terraform
choco install terraform  # Windows
brew install terraform    # Mac
sudo apt-get install terraform  # Linux

# Install AWS CLI
choco install awscli      # Windows
brew install awscli       # Mac
sudo apt-get install awscli  # Linux

Step 3: Configure AWS CLI
bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, region (us-east-1), and output format (json)

📥 Project Setup
Step 4: Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/samuel-nartey/aws-document.git
cd aws-document/auto-translate-pipeline
https:///docs/screenshots/setup/git-clone-success.png
Figure 5: Successful repository clone

Step 5: Review Project Structure
bash
tree . -I ".terraform"  # Hide terraform directory

🏗️ Infrastructure Deployment
Step 6: Initialize Terraform
bash
terraform init
https:///docs/screenshots/deployment/terraform-init-success.png
Figure 7: Terraform initialization successful

Step 7: Review Deployment Plan
bash
terraform plan
https:///docs/screenshots/deployment/terraform-plan-output.png
Figure 8: Terraform plan showing resources to be created

Step 8: Deploy Infrastructure
bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
https:///docs/screenshots/deployment/terraform-apply-complete.png
Figure 9: Terraform apply completed successfully

Step 9: Verify AWS Resources

🧪 Testing the Pipeline
Step 10: Upload Test Document
bash
# Upload a test file to the source S3 bucket
aws s3 cp test-document.txt s3://your-source-bucket-name/
https:///docs/screenshots/testing/s3-upload-success.png
Figure 11: Successful file upload to S3 source bucket

Step 11: Monitor Lambda Execution

Step 12: Check Output Bucket
bash
# List files in destination bucket
aws s3 ls s3://your-destination-bucket-name/
https:///docs/screenshots/testing/s3-output-files.png
Figure 13: Translated files in destination bucket

📊 Validation & Verification
Step 13: Verify Translation Quality
